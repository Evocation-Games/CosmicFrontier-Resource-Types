// Spin resources contain sprite info for simple graphical objects. Whenever Nova
// needs to load a set of sprites for a particular object, it looks at that
// object's spin resource, which in turn tells the game how to load the object's
// sprites. Nova sprites are stored as paired sprite and mask PICT resources, or
// as rleD/rle8 resources. The sprites in each PICT are arranged in a grid, which
// can be of any size. The spin resource tells Nova what shape and size the
// sprites' grid is.
//
// Spin resources have certain reserved ID numbers, which correspond to different
// types of objects:
// 400-463: Explosions
// 500: Cargo boxes
// 501-504: Mini-asteroids for mining
// 600-605: Main menu buttons
// 606: Main screen logo
// 607: Main screen rollover images
// 608-610: Main screen sliding buttons
// 650: Target cursor
// 700: Starfield
// 800-815: Asteroids
// 1000-1255: Stellar objects
// 3000-3255: Weapons
//
// It is important to note that the ID numbers of the PICT/rleD/rle8 resources
// are non-critical, as Nova looks at the spin resources to find the sprites, and
// not at the actual PICT/rleD/rle8 ID numbers themselves.
