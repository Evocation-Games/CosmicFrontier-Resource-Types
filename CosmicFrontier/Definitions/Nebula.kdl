// Nëbu resources contain info on the nebulae (or other space phenomena) which
// are displayed in the background of the star map. These images don’t actually
// have any effect on events in the game, they’re just there to look pretty. You
// can, however, combine nëbu background images with custom asteroid or
// interference data in the sÿst resources for cool localized effects, and you
// can also use the nëbu resource's OnExplore field to enable events when the
// player explores a certain nebula.

// The PICT resources associated with the 32 available nëbu resources are
// numbered 9500-9724. Each nebula can have up to seven PICT resources associated
// with it; the first nebula's PICTs are 9500-96, the second's are 9507-13, etc.
// The engine will pick the best nebula image to display for a given map scale
// (the map scales used in Nova are 42.1%, 56.2%, 75.0%, 100.0%, 133.3%, 177.7%,
// and 237.0%). If nebula image of the proper size for the current map scale
// isn't available, Nova will pick the closest one and stretch it as necessary.
// PICTs for a given nebula should be sorted by size in ascending order .
